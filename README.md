## Narration
Today we are going to be demonstrating how to create an easily reuseable retry wrapper for any async function

Let's kickoff with an example function that only works every second time you call it

```js
let _track = 0;
async function sometimesSucceeds() {
  if (++_track % 2 == 0) {
    return 'success';
  }
  throw new Error('fail');
}
```

This is just a place holder for a real world function that works unreliably.

We can demonstrate this unreliability, by calling this from a main function

```js
async function main() {
  try {
    console.log(await sometimesSucceeds()); // First call
  }
  catch (e) {
    console.log((e as Error).message);
  }
  console.log(await sometimesSucceeds()); // Second call
  try {
    console.log(await sometimesSucceeds()); // Third call
  }
  catch (e) {
    console.log((e as Error).message);
  }
  console.log(await sometimesSucceeds()); // Fourth call
}

main();
```

***Run demo***
We can add reliabitily to this function by wrapping it with a simple retry utility.
* Our retry utility takes an function that returns a promise of type T,
* And a number of attempts to try
* This function itself returns a promise of type T
  * Within body we track any last error
  * Next we try to call the function n times tracking the last error at each point,
* If the function never succeeds in the n times we throw the last error.

You can see that async await makes asynchronous retry wrappers just as easy as synchronous retry wrappers.

```js
async function retry<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>, n: number): Promise<T> {
  let lastError: any;
  for (let index = 0; index < n; index++) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    }
    catch (e) {
      lastError = e;
    }
  }
  throw lastError;
}
```

Now in our main function body we can easily create a safe version of the `sometimesSucceeds` function by wrapping it in a retry with 2 attempts.

Now if we call this safe function, you can see that it works reliably every single time.

```js
async function main() {
  const safe = () => retry(sometimesSucceeds, 2);
  console.log(await safe());
  console.log(await safe());
  console.log(await safe());
  console.log(await safe());
}
```

As a final example to demonstrate reusability, lets make the `sometimesSucceeds` function succeed only every 5th time and lets bump up our `safe` version to `10` reattempts

```js
let _track = 0;
async function sometimesSucceeds() {
  if (++_track % 5 == 0) {
    return 'success';
  }
  throw new Error('fail');
}
async function main() {
  const safe = () => retry(sometimesSucceeds, 10);
  console.log(await safe());
  console.log(await safe());
  console.log(await safe());
  console.log(await safe());
}
```

Using this pattern any unsafe function can be scaled to a desired level of reliability.
